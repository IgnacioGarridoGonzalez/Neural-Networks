# Neural-Networks

I. Concrete compressive strength:
  
  This model uses a collection of data of the composition of five types of concrete and their compressive strength. A neural network of two hidden layers is used to predict the compressive strength of a concrete for a test sample of concrete. The error function is plotted as well.
  The predicted targets are reasonable when the values for the loss function after training are small, but this does not always happen. The file "concrete_data.xlsx" attached in this repository is necessary to compile this program.
  

II. Celsius to Fahrenheit converter:

  This program uses as predictors a sample of seven temperatures in Celsius and an output sample of their values in Fahrenheit. The model consists of two hidden layers with 3 neurons each and the temperature in Fahrenheit as a target. A given temperature is input in Celsius and the result is predicted in Fahrenheit. 
  Also, the loss function is plotted as a function of the epochs, and the weights and biases of the model are printed.
