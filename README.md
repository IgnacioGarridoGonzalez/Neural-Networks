# Neural-Networks

I. Celsius to Fahrenheit converter:

  This program uses as predictors a sample of seven temperatures in Celsius and an output sample of their values in Fahrenheit. The model consists of two hidden layers with 3 neurons each and the temperature in Fahrenheit as a target. A given temperature is input in Celsius and the result is predicted in Fahrenheit. 
  Also, the loss function is plotted as a function of the epochs, and the weights and biases of the model are printed.
